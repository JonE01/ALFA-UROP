      "\n",
      "1) Base conversion and digit constraints:\n",
      "- If a decimal three-digit number abc (in base 10) equals bca in base 9, translate to positional-value equations:\n",
      "  - Decimal: 100a + 10b + c\n",
      "  - Base 9: 81b + 9c + a\n",
      "  - Set them equal and solve under digit constraints.\n",

      "  - Decimal hundreds digit a ∈ {1,…,9}; tens and ones b,c ∈ {0,…,9}.\n",
      "  - Base-9 digits must be in {0,…,8}; the leading base-9 digit must be nonzero.\n",
      "  - If a digit appears in both systems (e.g., the same symbol ‘a’ is a base-9 digit), enforce both constraints (e.g., then a ∈ {1,…,8}).\n",
      "- Use modular arithmetic to reduce search (e.g., from 100a+10b+c = 81b+9c+a, derive 99a = 71b + 8c; mod 71 gives 28a ≡ 8c (mod 71), i.e., 7a ≡ 2c (mod 71)), then check the small digit ranges.\n",

      "2) Palindromes in different bases (base 10 and base 8):\n",

      "- Useful identities for a,b,c with S1 = a+b+c, S2 = ab+bc+ca, S3 = abc:\n",
      "  - a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = S1·S2 − 3S3.\n",

      "- Key facts:\n",
      "  - By angle sum and bisector properties, ∠APD = ∠BQC = 90°.\n",
      "  - In an isosceles trapezoid, the segment PQ (intersection line of these bisectors) is parallel to the bases.\n",
      "  - Extending PQ to meet AD at P′ and BC at Q′ shows P′ and Q′ are midpoints of the legs; P′P = Q′Q = (leg)/2.\n",

      "    - Family B: slopes equivalent to 15°, 45°, 75° (3 orientations).\n",

      "  - Otherwise, all sets must have size ≥ 2. The only way to violate pairwise intersection among size ≥ 2 sets on a 5-element ground set is via a disjoint 2–3 pair; control this by selecting which 2-element subsets are included and excluding the corresponding complementary 3-sets.\n",
